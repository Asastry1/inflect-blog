<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We come from numerous backgrounds including Corporate Finance, Data Analytics Consulting, E-Commerce, but we all are united by a love for entrepreneurship. Our core belief is that every business can benefit from the appropriate application of technology. As a team of diverse individuals with experience in a wide range of fields and technical backgrounds, we are uniquely equipped to tackle the challenges of growing businesses through careful strategic collaboration. In our experience, individuals and organizations without existing technical expertise are faced with a choice of expensive and ill-fitting off the shelf solutions, or the use of execution-oriented freelance labor without the appropriate strategy or project understanding.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To address this gap, Inflect Solutions focuses on a close understanding of your business' needs followed by strategic brainstorming. Only after a clear and agreed upon vision has been achieved do we start diving into specific technologies, rather than simply fitting your problems to existing case studies. We like to believe that we resemble a think-tank rather than a development or consulting agency as innovation is our primary motivation. Our highly versatile team has worked with everything from legacy systems to bleeding edge applications and has a deep understanding of the costs and benefits of the numerous technologies that can be applied.</p>
